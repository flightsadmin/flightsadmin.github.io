# Laravel Livewire-crud Generator

A livewire CRUD Generation package to help scaffold basic site files. 

Package is autoloaded as per Psr-4 autoloading in any laravel version above ^5.6 so no extra config required. 

It uses auth middleware thus installs laravel/ui just incase you don't have any other auth mechanism.
> **This does not mean you have to use laravel/ui.** If you have any other Auth mechanism in place you are good to go.
