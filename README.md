# Introduction

A livewire CRUD Generation package to help scaffold basic site files. Package is autoloaded as per PSR-4 autoloading in any laravel version ^5.6 so no extra config required. However is has been tested on version ^7 & ^8. It uses auth middleware thus installs laravel/ui just incase you don't have any other auth mechanism, this does not mean you have to use laravel/ui.
